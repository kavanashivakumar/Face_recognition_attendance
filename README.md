# Face_recognition_attendance
Face Recognition Attendance system is an automated solution that uses facial recognition technology to mark attendance, replacing traditional methods like manual registers or RFID cards. It captures an image or video frame of a person, processes facial features using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, and matches them against a stored database to verify identity. This system enhances accuracy, security, and efficiency by minimizing human errors and preventing proxy attendance.  It can be Implementated in educational institutions, corporate offices, healthcare facilities, and government organizations, where real-time authentication ensures seamless and tamper-proof attendance tracking.
